            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As a research scholar at the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST), I specialize in wireless communications, antenna design, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), wireless power transfer, information theory, and physical layer security for next generation services. My work involves the design, optimization, and fabrication of advanced antennas and metasurfaces to enhance wireless energy transfer and secure wireless networks. I have contributed to peer-reviewed journals and international conferences, focusing on wireless communications, radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), software-defined radios (SDR), and AI-driven optimization. My technical expertise spans MATLAB, Python, CST Studio Suite, Keysight ADS, and AWRDE, enabling me to develop innovative solutions for secure and energy-efficient wireless systems. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, I am dedicated to advancing environmentally sustainable and resilient communication technologies.
            </p>
            </p>
                Beyond academia, I have amassed significant industry experience in network infrastructure, RF systems, and cybersecurity, working with Roke Telkom Uganda, SimbaNet, and Echotel in roles ranging from Network Infrastructure Engineer to Field Support Specialist. I have managed and optimized telecommunications networks, led cloud service migrations, and implemented secure network solutions to enhance service reliability. My hands-on experience in network security, cloud computing, and RF engineering complements my research, enabling me to bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications. Passionate about both research and industry innovation, I aim to apply my expertise in secure wireless communication systems, cybersecurity, and intelligent networks to drive advancements in national and global ICT infrastructure.

                <li>
                    <strong>Security and Reliability of Smart Agricultural Systems</strong>
                    <p>This work explores the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in precision agriculture, focusing on enhancing communication reliability, energy efficiency, and security. The integration of passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (PRIS) and non-reconfigurable metasurface-coated (NRMS) devices is highlighted as a promising solution. PRIS improve signal propagation and reduce interference, while also strengthening physical layer security to protect sensitive data in remote environments. NRMS devices further enhance energy efficiency by capturing and repurposing leaked energy, ensuring continuous data transmission without frequent battery replacements, and concentrating signals to protect against eavesdropping. These advancements are crucial for the sustainable and secure deployment of sensor networks in agricultural monitoring and similar applications.</p>

                    <strong>Towards Secure and Reliable Intelligent Transportation System</strong>
                    <p>As wireless communication systems move toward 6G, integrating Passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (PRIS) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is key to enhancing security, reliability, and energy efficiency in secure communication networks. In intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and vehicular networks, RIS improves signal propagation, physical layer security, and energy efficiency, addressing challenges like dynamic environments and eavesdropping risks. The focus is on secure channel modeling, advanced signal processing, and mitigating eavesdropping in complex conditions. RIS also offers solutions for urban communication challenges, improving signal quality, mitigating fading, and ensuring low-latency, high-reliability communication for autonomous vehicles and ITS.</p>

                    <strong>Antenna Design and Analysis for Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting Vehicular Networks</strong>
                    <p>This work develops a framework to address reliable communication, energy efficiency (EE), and security in vehicular networks (VNs) within intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It combines metasurface (MS)-coated antennas, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and optimized rectifiers to support communication and energy harvesting (EH) while ensuring physical layer security (PLS). The study leverages PLS to secure communication, optimizing energy harvesting and communication balance with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Experimental results show improved energy-focusing, signal quality, and security performance. The research provides a robust solution for energy-efficient and secure vehicular systems, advancing ITS and high-mobility applications.</p>

                    <strong>Revolutionizing MIMO, Coverage, and Privacy with Fluid Antenna System</strong>
                    <p>The Fluid Antenna System (FAS) introduces a transformative approach to MIMO technology by dynamically adjusting antenna configurations to optimize coverage, performance, and privacy in wireless communication networks. FAS enhances coverage by adapting to environmental factors such as mobility and interference, extending network reach while maintaining high throughput. It also strengthens privacy by using adaptive beamforming and spatial diversity to focus signals on legitimate users and reduce eavesdropping risks. This innovative system addresses key challenges in coverage, privacy, and system adaptability, offering a promising solution for the future of 5G, 6G,</p>

                    <strong>A Secure Multi-User Selection Scheme for the Internet of Things</strong>
                    <p>This work investigates physical layer security in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, focusing on a secure transmission scheme that combines multiple transmit antenna selection, selection combining, and zero-forcing beamforming to combat multiple eavesdroppers. It addresses both colluding and non-colluding eavesdropping scenarios, deriving closed-form expressions for secrecy outage probability (SOP), asymptotic SOP, and effective secrecy throughput. The study also explores power allocation strategies to optimize system performance, demonstrating that increasing the number of transmit antennas enhances secrecy and identifying optimal power allocation to minimize SOP and maximize throughput. This research improves secure communication in IoT networks, tackling resource constraints and eavesdropping threats.</p>
